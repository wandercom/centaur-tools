# centaur.tools — Full Context for AI Agents

> Community-governed registry for AI tools with provenance tracking and attribution.

## What It Is

centaur.tools is a community-governed registry for AI tools. Named after Kasparov's "centaur" concept — advanced chess where human and machine play together as partners. The registry exists so that when a platform ships something that looks like a prior community tool, the record exists.

The registry helps builders:
- find what's already been built
- discover who's working on similar problems
- preserve the incentives that keep independent builders building

## The Problem It Solves

The AI tools ecosystem has no citation norms. Platforms run opaque gatekeeping processes with misaligned incentives. Builders create tools; platforms ship similar features weeks later; there is no attribution infrastructure. The academic parallel — "you published first, you get the nod" — is a social contract that keeps people publishing. That contract is missing from the AI tools ecosystem.

Specific failure modes the registry addresses:
- Tools rejected from platform plugin directories despite strong user demand
- Tools subverted by platform features shipped shortly after community publication
- No mechanism for recognizing prior art or establishing provenance
- No community-owned discovery mechanism independent of platform gatekeepers

## Core Principles

- **Provenance**: Every tool carries its lineage. Forks link to parents. Overlapping problem spaces surface automatically.
- **Community Governance**: No gatekeepers. Usefulness votes from builders. Rotating moderation council.
- **Prior Art**: When a platform ships a feature an existing tool anticipated, the community flags it. The record is permanent.
- **MIT Only**: Everything is forkable. The only social contract is: cite your parents.

## Boundary Conditions

- MIT license only. No exceptions. Hard reject with explanation for non-MIT.
- No scores, rankings, featured lists, editor's picks, leaderboards.
- No single gatekeeper. Community governance with rotating council.
- GitHub OAuth only. No email/password.
- In-app notifications only. No email.
- Problem statement is the primary field for search and proximity, not description.
- Usefulness voting only. Not quality voting.
- Prior Art records are permanent once confirmed.
- Fork lineage is permanent and bidirectional.
- Founder (Jeremy McEntire) has structural veto for first 2 years, then transfers.

## Success Shape

Builders submit tools. On submission, they immediately see adjacent tools in their problem space — not as warnings, as introductions. "Three other centaurs are working on this. Here's who they are." When a platform ships a feature a week after a tool anticipated it, the community flags it as Prior Art. The record is permanent. The centaur was here first.

The forum is where builders coordinate. Categories for announcements, help, show-and-tell, and meta/governance. Tool pages have their own comment threads. Governance decisions happen in the open.

## Trust Model

- All reads are public and unauthenticated
- All mutations require GitHub OAuth
- Tool edits/deletes restricted to owner
- Moderation actions by rotating council (elected by vote)
- Moderation log is append-only and public
- Founder veto expires after 2 years

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: Astro + React + Tailwind CSS (SSR on Fly.io)
- Backend: Python FastAPI (separate Fly.io app)
- Database: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension (Fly.io managed)
- Embeddings: Gemini API (text-embedding-004)
- Auth: GitHub OAuth -> JWT in HttpOnly cookie
- Edge: nginx proxies /api/* to the backend service
