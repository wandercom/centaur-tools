# centaur.tools

> Community-governed registry for AI tools with provenance tracking and attribution. Named after Kasparov's "centaur" concept — advanced chess where human and machine play together as partners.

centaur.tools exists so that when a platform ships something that looks like a prior community tool, the record exists. The registry helps builders find what's already been built, discover who's working on similar problems, and preserve the incentives that keep independent builders building.

## Core Principles

- **Provenance**: Every tool carries its lineage. Forks link to parents. Overlapping problem spaces surface automatically.
- **Community Governance**: No gatekeepers. Usefulness votes from builders. Rotating moderation council.
- **Prior Art**: When a platform ships a feature an existing tool anticipated, the community flags it. The record is permanent.
- **MIT Only**: Everything is forkable. The only social contract is: cite your parents.
